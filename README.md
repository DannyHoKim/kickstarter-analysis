# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The data collected and organized in this project were created to help Louise make the best decision for funding a successfull Kickstarter Campaign. In the two analyses presented below, the data shows the outcomes of successful and unsuccessful Kickstarters based on either their launch dates or their financial goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data represented above, shows the correlation between the three various outcomes (Successful, Failed, or Canceled) of theater Kickstarters and the date that they were launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data represented above, shows the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled Kickstarter plays based on their financial goals. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were 2 notable challenges I encountered during this challenge.
#### Challenge 1: Human Error
I frequently found myself backtracking my work because of error messages that prevented me from moving forward. I found that many times I had either written a formula incorrectly or used the incorrect formula. To correct these mistakes I used Google often to find solutions to the errors and the correct formulas needed for a particular outcome.

#### Challenege 2: Github
Navigating Github was a challenge. I struggled particularly with customizing the markdown page. It took me multiple attempts to add images and organize the README to look presetable. Resovling this challenge took a lot of trial and error. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
