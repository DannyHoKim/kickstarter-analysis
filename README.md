# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The data collected and organized in this project were created to help Louise make the best decision for funding a successful Kickstarter Campaign. In the two analyses presented below, the data shows the outcomes of successful and unsuccessful Kickstarters based on either their launch dates or their financial goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data represented above shows the correlation between the three various outcomes (Successful, Failed, or Canceled) of theater Kickstarters and the date that they were launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data represented above, shows the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled Kickstarter plays based on their financial goals. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were 2 notable challenges I encountered during this challenge.
#### Challenge 1: Human Error
I frequently found myself backtracking my work because of error messages that prevented me from moving forward. I found that many times I had either written a formula incorrectly or used the incorrect formula. To correct these mistakes I used Google often to find solutions to the errors and the correct formulas needed for a particular outcome.

#### Challenege 2: Github
Navigating Github was a challenge. I struggled particularly with customizing the markdown page. It took me multiple attempts to add images and organize the README to look presentable. Resolving this challenge took a lot of trial and error. 
## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
- There is a sharp increase of successful Theater Kickstarters in the month of May with a gradual decrease as the months' progress. Based on the data launching it would be best for Louise to launch her Kickstarter in the month of May.
- There are more successful outcomes than there are failed or canceled, except in the month of December. For whatever reason, December would be the month to avoid launching a Kickstarter.

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- The highest percentage of successful Kickstarters had a financial goal of $4999 or less. In general, Plays that launched with a higher financial goal saw a lower chance of success; However, the sample size of higher goal Kickstarters is significantly less than those with lower financial goals. The data analysis would benefit from including more plays that had high financial goals to determine a more accurate trend line. 

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
- As mentioned above one of the limitations I see is in the sample size for Theater Kickstarters. There is a lot of data for Kickstarters with lower financial goals, but very few Kickstarters with higher financial goals. Because of this, the data may not accurately depict the outcomes based on goals. 
- This data set does not include promotions and advertisements made on social media, which could influence the success rate of these Kickstarters.
- There are a number of other variables we could include in our data set (Number of backers, average donation, duration of the campaign). Comparing and making correlations between other variables could result in more interesting conclusions.  

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- One possible graph we could create is to see the correlation between successful and failed Kickstarters based on the duration of the campaign. Are Kickstarter more successful the longer the campaign? Or does the opposite conclusion occur? For this kind of comparison, we could use a bar graph where we measure the weeks of the campaign on the x-axis and the number of campaigns on the y-axis. There would be 2 bars represented each week showing the number of successful and failed Kickstarters.
